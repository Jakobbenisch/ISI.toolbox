\title{Function for smoothing an xts vector}
\source{
\url{http://cristal.univ-lille.fr/~casiez/1euro/}
}
\usage{
OneEuroFilter(x, freq = 120, mincutoff = 1, beta = 1, dcutoff = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{xts vector to be smoothed.}

\item{freq}{A measure on how many data point are in one cycle. For instance samples per day. (1440 is dt = 1 minute)}

\item{mincutoff}{The greater mincutoff the less lag and more sensitive (less memory).}

\item{beta}{The smaller beta the smoother.}

\item{dcutoff}{The greater mincutoff the less lag and more sensitive (less memory).}
}
\value{
xts vector without the cut time window.
}
\description{
The function is for smoothing an xts or numeric vector. It's based on the publication by GÃ©ry Casiez.
For detailed description on how to use the filter please read the paper.
